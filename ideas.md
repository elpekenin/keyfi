Main idea
---------
Main MCU: STM32H750 (bigger QFN packages are out of stock currently :sad:)
  * QMK
  * 58 Hotwsap MX switches, Alice-like ortho layout
  * 24bit parallel display LTDC (with capacitive touch)
  * QSPI Flash?

Second MCU: ESP32S3 (WROOM-2?) - for wifi
  * CircuitPy? ESP-IDF?
  * LS0XX or small ST77xx/ILI9xxx to show current status

Comms over UART

Connectors
  * Unused GPIOs of both MCUs
  * Debug connectors

Maybe
